# ğŸ©º Diabetes Prediction App

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using a Machine Learning model trained on health-related parameters.

## ğŸš€ Features

- Predicts diabetes based on input health data
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Uses a pre-trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression or other classifier)

## ğŸ“Š Input Parameters

The following inputs are required:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## ğŸ§  Model Information

The ML model (`trained_model.sav`) was trained on a diabetes dataset (likely PIMA Indians dataset) using scikit-learn.

## ğŸ“¦ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
